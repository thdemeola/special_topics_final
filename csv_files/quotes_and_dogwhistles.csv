1,"And, the other day I was very honored to visit with the family of an amazing man, New York police detective Jonathan Diller, you read it, who was gunned down by a vicious thug, previously arrested by different law enforcement agencies over 21 times. Very serious crimes, and the person with him was known as ""Killer"". He was actually considered worse. He should never have been allowed to be on the streets again.",Donald Trump,"""thug""",racist,Black men are criminals or violent,Stereotype-based target group label,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYZBejq9Hmc
2,"We have migrant crime, add that onto the list. And it's among the most- the worst most heinous crime there is. These are tough people. These are people that have come out of those jails, they've come out of mental institutions. Just last weekend a band of four illegal alien thugs were arrested in Chicago after they approached a man in a subway car in the middle of the afternoon, robbed him, and viciously tried to strangle him. And they, also, were later tracked down at a migrant shelter that used to be occupied by the military. On day one, I will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens home.",Donald Trump,"""migrant crime""

3,"You have tons of surgeons and doctors at the Tavistock Institute in London quitting because they're being forced to perform sex reassignment treatment on children as young as six. And I quoted the numbers. It went from a few dozen minors asking for this treatment back in, I think it was less than 10 years ago, to now it's over 2,000. So it's probably times by about 500% over the past 10 years. And obviously that is because this warped gender ideology is being imposed on them by their parents. They're the victims and now huge numbers of people are quitting because they're refusing to conduct this treatment on little boys and girls as young as six.",Paul Joseph Watson (InfoWars),"""gender ideology""",transphobic,Trans people are threatening our way of life,Concept (other),https://fight.fudgie.org/search/episode/20190625_Tue_Alex#line13306
4,"All Ages drag show producer claims discrimination after a Utah city refuses to allow their Pride event. And apparently the ACLU is, of course, going to be suing.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the producer of an all-ages drag show, LGBTQ, have filed a lawsuit against the city of St. George, Utah, for rejecting their application for an event. And they're citing discrimination. They're being discriminated against because the groomers are not getting their all-age drag pedo event. You're discriminating against us because we can't strip and helicopter our genitals in front of little boys and girls! We can't groom kids! Discrimination! You're discriminating against our sexuality! Because you won't let the pedophiles strip in front of children! Bigots! Bigots! Bigots! Homophobe! Queerphobe! What a joke! These people are pedophiles, dude! Who the hell is gonna complain about not getting their way when it comes to wanting to put on an all-ages drag show?
I'll tell you who! Class pedophiles, groomers, and child molesters! That's who! All in the name of LGBTQ.",Adam King (InfoWars),"""groomers""",anti-LGBTQ,LGBTQ people are predators,Concept (other),https://fight.fudgie.org/search/episode/20230525_Thu_Alex#line12984
5,"Well, I mean, again, Libya has been destroyed by Hillary Clinton when she devastated the country, siding with al-Qaeda terrorists to oust Gaddafi. The country has degenerated into a terrorist-controlled bedlam. And people can get out or are getting out, but the radical Islamic terrorists who get out bring the radical Islamic terror with them. And that's the problem we're having right now in the UK and all across Europe. And it's not going to be resolved by politicians wishing that everyone would just get along, or this Islamophobia political correctness. Because this situation, as Donald Trump is pointing out, in this historic trip, is going to need the cooperation, in fact a reformation of Islam, in order to reject these radicals and to define that the religion is not encouraging violence.",Jerome Corsi (InfoWars),"""radical Islamic terrorists""",islamophobic,Muslim people as a whole are a threat,Stereotype-based descriptor,https://fight.fudgie.org/search/episode/20170529_Mon_Alex#line6388
6,"We've now spent 22 trillion dollars in the war on poverty, and we have about the same number of black Americans living under the poverty line as were living under the poverty line by the late 70s. The real issues that that are inter-, that are creating intergenerational poverty, everyone knows this, but remains true. The number one predictor of intergenerational poverty in the United States remains single motherhood. The single motherhood rate in the black community was 20 percent in 1960. It is upward of 70 percent today. That's not unique to the black community, by the way, it's true in the white community as well. 5 percent of white kids were born out of wedlock in 1960. Today, it's upward of 40 percent. That is not- something has happened. It is not a matter of increased racism. That's not happening because of increased racism. Right. That that is happening because there has been a cultural change that does not place tremendous emphasis for black or white or for anybody on personal responsibility and personal agency.",Ben Shapiro (on Joe Rogan Experience #1512),"""personal responsibility""",racist,Opposition to public spending perceived to benefit racial minorities over white people,Concept (values),https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/-1512-ben-shapiro/
